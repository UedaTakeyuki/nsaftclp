Preface

Congratulations on your finishing the C language primer. I know now you can make any usefull programs handling files and console input / output. 
And I can easy imagine that you are confusing how to make Desktop application passing and accepting JSON data by HTTP protocol.
The C language has a longer history than Computer Desktop, JSON and HTTP. 
The first edition of the original C language primer which is known as ["K&R"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) was published at year 1978, There were neither computer Desktop, JSON, nor HTTP protocol back then.
