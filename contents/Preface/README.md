Preface

Hi guys have completed the Introduction to C Language. Congratulations now you can make any useful programs to hande any **files** and **console IO**. I can hear you blaming "That's all?ã€€Just **files** and **console IO**?, How can I make a cool **Desktop** application passing and accepting **JSON** data via **HTTP** protocol in C?". Since you have completed the introduction to the C language, you must be familiar with handling the standard library of the C language, but unfortunately, there is no such **modern kind of stuff** there.

Because the C language has a longer history than Computer Desktop, JSON and HTTP, the first edition of the original C language primer which is known as ["K&R"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) was published in the year 1978, there was neither computer Desktop, JSON, nor HTTP protocol back then.
Even the year 1988 when the 2nd edition was published, this was a year before I graduated from university with a degree in high-energy theoretical physics and started my career as a software engineer, I remember well that desktop computing was a luxury item available only on expensive UNIX workstations.
