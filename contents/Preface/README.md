Preface

Congratulations on your finishing the C language primer. Now you can make any useful programs handling files and console input/output. 
I can easily imagine that you are confused about how to make a Desktop application pass and accept JSON data by HTTP protocol.

Because the C language has a longer history than Computer Desktop, JSON and HTTP, the first edition of the original C language primer which is known as ["K&R"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) was published in the year 1978, there was neither computer Desktop, JSON, nor HTTP protocol back then.
Even the year 1988 when the 2nd edition was published, this was a year before I graduated from university with a degree in high-energy theoretical physics and started my career as a software engineer, I remember well that desktop computing was a luxury item available only on expensive UNIX workstations.
